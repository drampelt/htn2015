# Inspiration
We want to use the power of automation and Artificial Intelligence to affect any field possible. Job Interviews should not be an exception.

# What it does
We have an interviewer and a candidate for a technical job. We can translate speech to text By using Machine Learning algorithms, we detect the quality of answers given by the candidate and mark them based on their performance. In addition, we analyze their facial expressions in general to determine their personalities and whether they're fit for company's culture.

# How we built it
- The app is built with RoR. 
- We have used ``firebase`` to create a collaboration tool for the interviewer - and the candidate. 
- We have used ``WebRtc`` with ``Peerjs`` to create a real time video - conference. 
- We have used Google's ``Web Speech API`` to translate audio to text and keep - the interview process as records and have access to analyzing each - candidate's answers.


# Challenges we ran into
WebRtc not working well.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Disabling one browser extension, and this solving most of our problems.

# What we learned
# What's next for TalentScale
